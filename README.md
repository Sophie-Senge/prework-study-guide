# <Prework Study Guide Webpage SP>

## Description

I built this webpage to contain all the crucial notes and building blocks required to know when starting out in a bootcamp for front-end web developing. It will contain the most essential items in an easily digestible format. Solving the problem of scrolling through blogs and other heavily loaded listurature. Through this process, I have learned the very beginnning stages and process of how to build a webpage from scratch.

Each section contains notes about the topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework at boorcamp and the user can choose one topic, or topic by topic, to study.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
